<p> As I woke up this morning, I was trembled on my dream where my father is shouting at me and said "Magsaing kana!" -- luckily, there was.
It's also my pleasure to meet you. I came where corrupt administration reigns and biased -- poor public service occurs, welcome to <FONT COLOR="RED">Pasay City! </FONT> </p>
<br>
<p> Well, I wished I can tell you some of my adventures, but unfortunately there are mine to keep. Don't worry, I still have another category to speak about. In my freshmen year, I joined different organization where I was unexpectedly nominated as a executive board member. They kept and trained me on how to speak and debate appropriately. I'm using it for my further cost on my daily living, especially on my studies which is a fundamental skill to have -- on the modern society, at least. A memorable event occurred when I compete on a debate inter-varsity as a member of this organization which is a hard task to do. But, despite of all circumstances I was able to fight and learn as much as possible that I can use on my further exploration in this society. </p> 
<br>
<p> Moving forward, there are many things that are surprising for each person and I'll gladly tell you mine. One of those is being open-minded when most people are not. Regardless of my religion and family orientation, I keep my own perspective and opinion about life and how to deal with it. Because at first, it is not their life to live. but it's mine -- alone. Surely, they can guarantee to give me guidance that I would need, but the decisions that I would chose is not theirs to make. </p>
<br>
<p> To end this speech, I'm expecting that our professor would guide us on the fountain of knowledge where information, skills, etc. waits ahead to be drink or sip by her students because learning isn't the professor`s task to do. </p>
